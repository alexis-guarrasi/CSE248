Problems:
1. Price changes for condiments will force us to alter exsiting code
2. New condiments will for us to add new methods and alter teh cost method in the super class
3. New beveage (cold brew?, iced tea? sweet cold brew?).  With new beverage, some condiments
	may not apply (A Tea with whip? yuck?)
4. Double mocha?
